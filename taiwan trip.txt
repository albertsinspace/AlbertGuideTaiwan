Albert's "definitive"(ish) travel guide to Taipei, Taiwan C:

--- Places I've visited (with reviews) ---

-- Taipei 101 --
Tallest tower in Taipei! Very cool to see since it's huge. To get to the top floor you'll have to buy a ticket. In fact I believe you have to buy a ticket anyway to go up the tower regardless of top floor. These tickets cost around 600 NT$. Plenty of souvenirs around on the bottom floor. There is also a restaurant located there called Din Tai Fung which I talk more about below. 

-- Din Tai Fung --
Super nice food, plenty of different types of dumplings to choose from. Booking is done online or over phone, this has to be done a week in advance I believe. However you can book a table right then and there when you show up if you'd like. Also if you're curious, there is actually dumpling merch if you want it. Dumpling plushies, dumpling keychains etc. This is right outside the resturant entrance itself as you walk-in. If you don't book a table expected wait times are usually 30-45 minutes. Not too long at all and service is very fast. 

-- A-Mei Teahouse --
Unfortunately I couldn't get inside. Reservations are actually not over phone or website turns out. Apparently you gotta wait outside which can take a really long time. However, the exterior is very beautiful and is a great place to just visit to be able to see in person what it looks like. Another great thing is that it is in the same general location of the Jiufen Old Street, I talk about that a bit below so you can read more if you'd like.

The old street however is very nice with plenty of street style places to eat and things to buy. Great views too. I think you have to walk through this way to get to the teahouse so it's a sort of 2 in 1 experience. 

-- National Theater and Concert Hall -- 
Very beautiful architecture. It's huge and you can find a lot of students there practicing dance or any sort of sport. I asked about this and turns out in Taiwan you gotta pick a club or thing to do which can be dance and students will practice outside the main entrance under the shade. You can't go up I don't think but it's nice to walk around in this area to enjoy the amount of space there is. 
This area is also free to walk around unless you wanna watch a concert inside the hall itself.

General tip, please wear lots of suncream and even bring an umbrella if you want. Sunglasses are also a must! Seriously, it almost feels like walking on the surface of the sun with a constant flashbang in your face. I had to find this out the hard way.... 
That is if you go during the day which I recommend, during the night and you won't be able to see much since there are no lights from what I recall. Also this place has a looot of stuff around it and in the area, I suggest walking around because there is a lot more such as memorial sites, a mini museum at the back of the place and some restaurants nearby. Within the area that you enter of course, not outside outside but there should be a like this 25 meter wide path you can follow more or less which will lead down to a bunch of steps going up to a large temple like building and if you walk all the way down and turn left and then around there should be a museum of the place behind it all. If this is a bit confusing, feel free to send me pictures if you go! I will guide you the best I can. 

-- Bangka Longshan Temple --
This place is quite small, takes about 30 seconds to walk around the entire place or 2 minutes if you look around. It's a Buddhist temple and a lot of people will come here to say their prayers or offer food and goods. It's nice to visit and the design of the entire place is beautiful. 

-- Huaxi Street Night Market --
This is a night market which is actually aimed at tourists. I honestly wouldn't recommend it, not all that much to do in this area. Better if you can find another one since this one is aimed at selling a bunch of stuff. As expected too, lots of tourists. 

-- Yehliu Geopark --
This is a massive area which you can walk around outside that has this statue that apparently looks like the head of a queen (ehh sorta imo). The area itself is massive and you'll probably walk around for a good hour to see everything. There is some shade but best to bring a hat, umbrella and shades. Also lots of suncream as per usual. There is also a mini cafe near the main entrance building if you wanna get a nice cold drink to take with you. I actually spilled some of mine onto the mini bridge I was walking across and that probably wasn't good so try not to do that. There is also more to this area than just the Queen head since you also get several other stone statues on the way to it and a super nice view of the ocean. I can't seem to remember what the ticket price is so looking it up I get 80 - 216 NT$ so try make sure you have at least that amount on you, possibly more. But the ticket should be no more than 500 NT$ at the maximum. If it is, don't buy it it's probably a scam. 

-- Jiufen Old Street --
Soo this is the place where you gotta walk through to get to A-Mei Teahouse. Very nice area, looots of food. You could probably go on a food tour here if you wanted just from the sheer amount of local snacks you can buy. I couldn't eat everything because my allergy restricted me quite a bit since a lot of snacks have nuts. But if you wanna get something tasty as well as enjoy high mountain views, this is the place. Very crowded though so be wary of possible pickpocketers. Keep your stuff close. I didn't have any issue but just general caution in any tourist place I suppose.

-- National Palace Museum --
Amazing, really really good. Full of jade artifacts. Price for entry is about 350 NT$. This place has a huge collection of just every single priceless piece. From old weapons and materials, to jewels and gems. There's not much I can actually say about this place since a museum is a museum but this one is a place you should visit if you get the chance. Also plenty of information you can read next to each artifact which is translated into english I believe. I would say to fully enjoy everything, it would take about 2-3 hours. I almost forgot to mention but there is a very nice resturant here called Silks Palace which I believe requires booking but there is also a line which you can wait in I'm certain. Will double check this info. Will update you soon.
